# To-Do App

A simple and responsive To-Do app built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Ant Design**. This app allows users to add, delete, and organize tasks into different categories (To-Do, Doing, Completed). The tasks are stored locally using **localStorage**, so they persist across page reloads.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can enter task titles, assign tags, and select a status (To-Do, Doing, or Done).
- **Task Management**: Tasks can be categorized and displayed in different columns based on their status.
- **Tag System**: Tags can be assigned to tasks. Tags are clickable and can be selected/deselected.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts dynamically for different screen sizes using **TailwindCSS**.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are stored in **localStorage** and persist even after page refresh.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:  
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - TailwindCSS
  - Ant Design

- **State Management**: React `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

- **Storage**: `localStorage` for storing tasks.
